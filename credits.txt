This project use the python module called pygame. All pygame functions come from the pygame documents at https://www.pygame.org/docs/


Some functions are learned, though not directly copied or edited, from the pygame flappy bird project here https://github.com/sourabhv/FlapPyBird


Some codes are from the flappy bird AI. I format my own code to his style because I don't know how to use json file to store and read information. http://sarvagyavaish.github.io/FlappyBirdRL/


The game is trying to implement a game called "nidhogg". Some audios are from this game's resources. You can learn more about it here http://messhof.com/game/nidhogg/
