Junhui He's 15-112 Fall 2017 Term Project

Project:
This project is trying to implement the game called "nighogg" in pygame. It trys to take the smooth movement of the game, with an AI that learns from player's action. Player/User can use an Estoc to fight to another Player or an AI that uses "Q-learning".

How to Run:
To use the program, first run the "qvalueTest.py" to reset the AI learning. The AI would become fresh and "stupid". But after some time of training, it would recognize users input and choose the best strategy (with some errors) it learns.
After that, run the "mainGame.py" to begin.

Also, put the 'Resources' folder in the same file when you run it.



Note:
pygame module from python is required
python 3 is required
This project is made on python on my own mac, so with differences in OS or the versions of python, the project might NOT always work perfectly.
